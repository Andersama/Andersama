There are many programming libraries out there, and here is part of my own. The utilties here are written to be:
* **Performant:** Whatever approach is taken, whether naive or complex the overall result should be fast.
* **Scalable:** The algorithms and processes chosen are ideally linear or sublinear where possible.
* **Memory Conscious:** Functions don't allocate if they don't need to.
* **Exceptionless:** Functions don't throw exceptions if they don't need to.

## C++ Single Header Files and Libraries
* [C++ Branch](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B) - A collection of some of my personal c++ libraries
  * [always_force_inline](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/always_force_inline) - A header for a macro to force inline functions `always_force_inline`
  * [always_flatten_calls](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/always_force_inline) - A macro to hint to the compiler to flatten the body of a function `always_flatten_calls`
  * [always_inline_call](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/always_inline_call) - A macro to hint to the compile to inline a statement `always_inline_call`
  * [never_inline](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/blob/c%2B%2B/never_inline/never_inline.h) - A macro to hint to the compile to leave the function call as is `never_inline`
  * [headers](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/headers) - A set of headers that groups common standard c++ headers together
  * [simple_benchmark](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/simple_benchmark) - A single header for benchmarking, even smaller than nanobench!
  * [stack_vector](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/stack_vector) - A header for a vector which lives on the stack
  * [inline_vector](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/inline_vector) - A header to treat contiguous data like a vector in a span-like manner
  * [waterhash](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/waterhash) - An implementation of waterhash, but as a module and constexpr!
  * [wheathash](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B/wheathash) - An implementation of wheathash, but as a module and constexpr!
  * [and more!...](https://github.com/Andersama-Library/open-source/tree/c%2B%2B)
